# {{{apiName}}}

Koa API following [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) 1.1 specification.

## Setup

- `pnpm install`
{{#if (has features "appconfig")}}
- copy `dev-app-config.toml.dist` to `dev-app-config.toml` and fill out values
{{/if}}
{{#if (has features "postgres")}}
- `docker compose up -d`
{{/if}}
- `pnpm start`
{{#if (has features "postgres")}}

    ## Postgres

    Use the MikroORM CLI to create and run migrations:

    ```bash
    pnpm mikro-orm help
    ```
{{/if}}
{{#if (has features "appconfig")}}

## AppConfig

This project uses AppConfig for additional configuration parameters. Once an environment is deployed, there will be two
AppConfig applications available:

- `{{{apiName}}}-uat`
- `{{{apiName}}}-prod`

For local development, the file `dev-app-config.toml.dist` and `dev-app-config.toml` should reflect the same config.
You should store non-sensitive values in the `.dist` file, while secrets should be left blank and filled out when
cloning the repository.

Within AppConfig and locally, a Zod schema validates the configuration. This schema can be found under `src/app-config`.

### Deployment

During the first deployment of an environment, CloudFormation will hang while you set up the initial configuration. Fill
in the config in AppConfig for the environment and deploy it. After a few minutes CloudFormation will recognize that the
service is stable and finish deployment.

When adding configuration on subsequent deployments you should add new values to AppConfig preemptively and deploy the
new configuration. While this will not give you any validation at that step, it prevents a long CloudFormation run.

### Handling configuration updates

When deploying a new configuration in a running environment, the API will pick up changes within 15 seconds. This means
that you should treat the configuration as always changing. Use `getAppConfig()` whenever you need to access a
configuration value and don't store the result.

For configuring objects like clients and such, there is a helper in the `app-config` folder named
`createConfiguredObjectGetter()`. Refer to its documentation for further details. If you don't need it, you can remove
its file and its dependency `memize` from this project.
